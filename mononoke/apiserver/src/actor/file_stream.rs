// NOTE: This FileStream wrapper is a bit of a hack while we have an API server that builds on top
// of a BlobRepo abstraction that flattens streams. Indeed, in the API server, we need to know if a
// file is going to exist before we create a response using its stream of bytes. Otherwise, when we
// tell Actix to serve a response using that stream, we don't know if the file exists, so we tell
// Actix to serve up a 200. When Actix tries reading the stream to send it to the client, it gets a
// "not found" error, but by then it's too late to serve a 404 to the client, and Actix just closes
// the connection (it doesn't send _anything_ back, in fact). So, we "fix" that by requiring that
// binary responses have to be created from a FileStream, and the only way to create a FileStream
// is to give it a Stream, and doing that will poll for the first element of the stream to see if
// it's an error (which effectively undoes the flattening BlobRepo did). This is meant to be a
// temporary fix while we work out a better API for getting file streams out of Blobrepo.
//
// If you'd like to refactor this, then the right way to test your fix is to ask a streaming
// endpoint for something that doesn't exist. If you get a 404, you succeeded, congratulations! If
// the connection is closed, or you get a 500, try again :(
