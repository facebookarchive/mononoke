//! SSH/stdio line-oriented protocol

//!
//! The encoding is:
//! ```text
//! command := <command> '\n' <key-value>{N}
//! key-value := star | kv
//! star := '*' ' ' <count> kv{count}
//! kv := <name> ' ' <numbytes> '\n' <byte>{numbytes}
//! ```
//!
//! Where `N` is the specific number of `<key-value>` pairs expected by the command.
//!
//! The types of the values are implied by the command rather than explicitly encoded.
//!
//! pair := <hash> '-' <hash>
//! list := (<hash> ' ')* <item>
//!
//! Responses to commands are almost always:
//! ```text
//! <numbytes> '\n'
//! <byte>{numbytes}
//! ```
//!
//! The expections are requests that pass streaming arguments (f.e. unbundle). After such a
//! requests the responder should respond with
//! ```text
//! '0\n'
//! ```
//! to acknowledge readiness for processing the stream. After the stream is fully read the
//! responder should respond with a stream (no acknowledgment is required).
//!
//! Each command has its own encoding of the regular or streaming responses, although by
//! convention the streaming responses are chunked. See `hgproto/dechunker.rs` for the format of
//! chunking.
