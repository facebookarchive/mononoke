// that are hashing data, so in practice, this buffer is only useful to smooth out one task hitting
// a bit of latency for some reason. It doesn't need to be very large (in fact, empirically, I've
// observed that it needs to be very small), and it shouldn't be mistaken with the Filestore's
// upload concurrency, which is how many upload tasks will be running concurrently (those are tasks
// that perform I/O); those tasks are spawned by prepare.rs, and their number is controlled by the
// Filestore's upload concurrency level.
