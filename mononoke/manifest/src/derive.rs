/// Construct a new manifest from parent manifests and a list of changes from a bonsai commit.
/// The manifest is constructed in accordance with bonsai semantic (see below for explanation).
///
/// Parent manifests should have been constructed for each parent of this bonsai commit
/// (note that there can be more than 2 parents).
///
/// In the context of this function "manifest" means a set of leaves and trees. Manifest is a
/// recursive structure that starts with a root tree which can point to other trees or leaves.
/// Each leaf represents a file in a repository, and each tree represents a directory.
///
/// Note that while `derive_manifest` can be used to construct Mercurial manifests
/// (e.g. Manifests where leafs are filenodes), it's not limited to them. Leafs can be arbitrary
/// ids e.g. SHA-1 content of a file, unode ids. Tree ids can also be arbitrary.
///
/// ## Bonsai Semantic
/// Bonsai semantic is a set of rules about how to apply changes to manifests. Each change is
/// either `Some(Leaf)` meaning that a new file exists in the new commit (either new file is
/// created or reused from one of the parents), `None` meaning that the file was deleted from
/// one of the parents and no longer exist in the new bonsai commit.
/// Also see: [Bonsai changeset actions](https://fb.quip.com/A2kqArd9Nb90)
///
/// Changes are applied recursively starting from the root of parent manifests.
/// Here is how changes affect conflict resolution
/// 1. If no change ends on the current path or any subpaths e.g. we are just merging parent
///    manifests.
///    - If all entries in parent manifests are identical (regardless of whether they are trees
///      or leaves) then we are just reusing the current entry.
///    - If all parents entries are trees then recurse into all of them and continue merging.
///    - If all parent entries are leaves then `create_leaf` is called with `None` leaf, this
///      can result in successful merge (for example, mercurial can merge different entries with
///      same content).
///    - If we have a mix of leaves/trees in parent entries - we have a broken commit and this is
///      an unresolved conflict error.
/// 2. If no change ends on the current path BUT there are changes on the subpaths (e.g. we are
///    on "A/", but there's "A/file.txt").
///    - If all parents entries are trees then recurse into all of them and continue merging
///    - If we have a single leaf in parent entries - we have a broken commit and this is an
///      unresolved conflict error.
/// 3. Current path have `None` change associated with it.
///   - Only trees: invalid changes.
///   - Only leaves: all leaves are removed.
///   - Mix of leaves/trees: all leaves are removed, recurse into the trees.
/// 4. Current path have `Some(leaf)` change associated with it.
///   - _: all the trees are removed in favour of this leaf.
///
